# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Added explicit Python optional extras (`plot`, `notebooks`, `parity`, `dev`) and migrated onboarding docs to extras-first install commands.
- Standardized install/import naming guidance: install `changepoint-doctor`, import `cpd`, with optional `changepoint_doctor` compatibility alias.
- Added notebook/docs path guardrails and normalized notebook onboarding to clone-safe, repo-relative instructions.
- Published product-grade CLI documentation (`cpd/docs/cli.md` and docs-site CLI getting-started page), including JSON output mode controls.
- Aligned Cargo workspace metadata and `CITATION.cff` to canonical repository identity with explicit provenance notes.
- Enabled preprocess support in default Python wheel builds, converted integration coverage to the positive preprocess path, and extended wheel-smoke checks to fail if preprocess support regresses.
- Added runtime build provenance support (`diagnostics.build`) with compile-time metadata capture in `cpd-core`, Python/CLI adapter context enrichment, canonical schema coverage for build metadata, and CI-gated JSON Schema validation for fixtures plus live Python outputs.
